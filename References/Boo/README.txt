From Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boo_(programming_language)

Boo is an object-oriented, statically typed, general-purpose programming 
language that seeks to make use of the Common Language Infrastructure's support
for Unicode, internationalization, and web applications, while using a
Python-inspired syntax and a special focus on language and compiler
extensibility. Some features of note include type inference, generators, 
multimethods, optional duck typing, macros, true closures, currying, 
and first-class functions.

Boo was one of the three scripting languages for the Unity game engine
(Unity Technologies employed De Oliveira, its designer), until it was dropped
in 2014 due to the small userbase. Despite official support for Boo ending,
the language could still be used in Unity, until the Boo compiler was removed
from the engine in 2017.

Boo is free software released under the BSD 3-Clause license.
It is compatible with the Microsoft .NET and Mono frameworks.
